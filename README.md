# Summary

# Result

The results that follow are also shown in the report, as figures displaying the motion. The same order used in the report is used here. This is true for all videos except those that are called `Other`, which was not included in the report.

The report should be read in order for this to make sense. The report can be found on the repository that has a link at the top
